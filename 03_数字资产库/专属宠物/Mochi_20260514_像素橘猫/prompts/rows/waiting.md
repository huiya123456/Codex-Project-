Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `mochi`, state `waiting`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 6 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure green #00FF00. Treat the row as 6 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: Preserve the reference identity: chubby cream-orange tabby cat, round face, oversized glossy black eyes, tiny pink nose, soft cheek blush, blue bow tie with white pixel highlights, small yellow tag, fluffy compact body, warm kawaii pixel-art personality.. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `pixel`: Pixel-art-adjacent digital mascot with a chunky silhouette, simple dark outline, limited palette, flat cel shading, and visible stepped edges. User style notes: High quality kawaii pixel art, thick dark outline, compact full-body sprite, no readable text on tag, clean chroma-key background for extraction..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Needs-input loop: expectant asking pose for approval, help, or user input.

State requirements:
- Show that Codex needs approval, help, or user input through an expectant asking pose.
- Keep the motion patient and readable, without turning it into ordinary idle or review.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
